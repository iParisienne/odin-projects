# Odin Project > Foundation - Landing Page

Landing page which is based on the task specifications.
Two minor modifications added:

1. Gave the **<div>** containers an ID so you can scroll to them via anchor link (automatically).
2. A back-to-top button, which becomes active at a certain Y-height and brings the user back to the top.
